# NLTK Movie Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains Python code for performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The project utilizes NLTK for text preprocessing and feature extraction, along with a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment classification.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess movie review text data, including tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of stopwords.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: Train a Naive Bayes classifier on labeled movie review data.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Evaluate the classifier's accuracy on a separate test set of movie reviews.
- **Example Usage**: Demonstrate how to use the trained classifier to classify new movie review sentences.
